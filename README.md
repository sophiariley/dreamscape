# Dreamscape

Dreamscape is an Android social media app focused on the user's love of traveling.
Users can post pictures and videos from the trips they have been on, sharing them with
other users. Other users can then see a trip that looks intriguing and 'Create A Trip'
to the same destination through the app. This includes communicating with other users that 
might want to go on this trip as well, planning arrival and departure days, 
listing hotels and flight plans, and other beneficial options. Dreamscape is a place for people to connect and
share trips they have been on in hopes that everyone finds new destinations to travel 
to that they otherwise might not have chosen.
